## Sample REST application that deals with a garage. The garage has 150 spaces for cars. Its API can be summarized as follows:
GET call at /garage returns information of filled/free car parking slots,
- POST call at /garage/slots parks a new car at the next free parking slot,
- PUT call at /garage/slots/{slotID} parks a car at a specific parking slot,
- GET call at /garage/slots/{slotID} gives information on the availability of a specific slot, and
- DELETE call at garage/slots/{slotID} empties that slot (the car leaves the garage).
